## Projects
**Predicting Drug Ratings| The University of Texas at Arlington |(_May 2024- July 2024_)**

Built supervised models on review metadata to predict user drug ratings.

- Conclusion/Impact
    - Built a model that reliably predicts user-provided drug ratings from available features, outperforming simple baselines.
    - Feature importance highlighted review language and key metadata as strong predictors, informing which inputs matter most.
- Key Challenges
    - Ordinal target: Ratings are ordered (e.g., 1–10). Treating it as plain classification can ignore “distance” between classes.
    - Class imbalance: Fewer extreme ratings vs. many mid-range scores.
- Techniques Used
    - Models: Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, with grid/random search for hyperparameters.
    - Validation: Stratified k-fold; metrics like accuracy/F1 for classification.
- What else could be done
    - Better text signals: Use transformer embeddings (e.g., BERT) or sentence embeddings with a shallow classifier.
    - Interpretability: SHAP for local/global explanations, partial dependence for key features.

**Topic Modeling for Research articles|  The University of Texas at Arlington |(_October 2024- December 2024_)**

Designed NLP pipelines to extract themes from cybersecurity/privacy papers and mapped co-authorship networks to highlight influential authors.

- Conclusion/ Impact
  - Extracted coherent themes from cybersecurity/privacy literature, surfaced recurring topics.
  - Mapped co-authorship networks, identifying influential authors and collaboration clusters, identifying domain leaders.
- Key Challenges
  - Choosing k (topics): Balancing interpretability vs. granularity, avoiding redundant/overlapping topics.
  - Domain vocabulary: Acronyms/jargon, rapidly evolving terminology.
- Techniques Used
  - Topic models: LDA, LSI, NMF, and transformer-based pipelines (BERT, BUNKA).
  - Network analysis: Co-authorship graph construction, degree centrality, and visualization (VosViewer).
- What else could be done
  - LLM-assisted labeling: Use an LLM to propose human-readable topic labels and summaries, validate with SMEs.
